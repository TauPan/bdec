'bdec', a library to decode binary files from an xml specification.

Binary formats typically aren't easily specified; the are rarely specified
in a high level marked language such as ASN.1 (and such specifications
cannot be retro-fitted to existing binary formats). 'bdec' is an attempt
to specify arbitrary binary formats in a markup language, and create a
decoder automatically for that binary format given the high level
specification.

The idea stems from work I did at Aeroflex Cambridge, which required
decoding of mobile telephone protocol data. The xml specification used
here is similar to the specifications developed there; both are derived
from the constructs used in ASN.1.


Usage
=====

The bdec library consists of a decoding library and a command line decoding
application. Given a specification, the command line application will
create an xml representation of the data contained in the file.

The library is capable of creating such xml output, or optionally a python
object representing the constructs contained in the binary data.

For example; the `xml representation of a FAT bootsector`_ generated by
running

  dd if=/dev/sda1 bs=512 count=1 | decode bootsector.xml

.. _xml representation of a FAT bootsector: doc/files/fatbootsector.xml


Advantages
==========

* It is easy to write (and read) a specification
* No need to write a custom decoder (all error conditions are handled 
  internally; decoding either passes or fails).
* The command line application allows visual inspection of problematic
  files.
* Unicode aware, little-endian / big-endian aware
* Specify fields down to the bit (eg: single bit flags)
