    <!--
      It can be useful to define common references. For example, the ddlp
      specification uses textual numbers, and there is a common entry named
      'amount' which is 5 digits. It is useful to define 'amount' to be a
      reference to a '5 digit text' entry, and when this 'amount' referenced,
      is effectively creating a reference to a reference.
