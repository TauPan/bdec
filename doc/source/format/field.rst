Field entries
=============

Field entries are the core element in a specification; they represent all the
data that is found in the binary file. Some characteristics of this data are;

  * The data on disk can be many types, such as text (in any encoding),
    integers, and buffers.
  * The length of the data can be of any; it may be a fixed length, or it may
    be :ref:`variable length <bdec-expressions>`. The data may be less than a 
    byte in length, and it may not be byte aligned.


Specification
=============

Bdec fields can have 4 attributes;

  * A name
  * A :ref:`length <bdec-expressions>` in bits
  * A type_ (optional)
  * An encoding (optional)

.. _type: `Field types`_


Field types
===========

There are currently four available field types. If the type is not specified,
it is assumed to be binary_.

Integers
--------

Integer fields represent numeric values in the data file. There are two types
of encodings supported, `little endian and big endian`_.

The default encoding is big endian.

.. _little endian and big endian: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness 


Text
----

Text fields represent textual data in the binary file (ie: data that can be
printed). It can use any unicode encoding, and defaults to ascii.


Hex
---

Hex fields represent binary data whose length is a multiple of whole bytes. It
has no encoding.


Binary
------

Binary fields represent binary data of any length. It has no encoding.


Examples
========

A numeric field that is 2 bytes long, in big endian format::

   <field name="data" length="16" type="integer" encoding="big endian" />

A utf-16 text field that is 8 bytes long::

   <field name="name" length="64" type="text" encoding="utf16" />

A single bit boolean flag::

   <field name="is header present" length="1" />
